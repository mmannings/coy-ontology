## Modeling Trade in Value Added (TiVA) 2021 indicators

The TiVA indicators represents global flows and services. It has four views [1].

 1. The origin of value added,
 2. Exporters,
 3. Importers,
 4. Final consumers.

Each of these views can be represented using tables [1]. To express TiVA 2021 indicators as an ontology, we modeled each TiVA view using tree structure design pattern. 

### Origin of value added in gross exports
Origin of value added in gross exports provides estimates of total gross exports by exporting industry i in country c broken down by the value added generated by source industry h in country p (see page 40 in [1]).
